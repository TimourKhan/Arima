        <p>Arima is a font family that has 7 different line weights; <br>
            Thin, Extra Light, Light, Regular, Medium, SemiBold and Bold.<br>
            It has elements of calligraphy and utilizes soft edges to give a flowy look.</p>
            <br>
        <p>The goal of it is to appeal to both casual and professional designers.<br>
            It has extended support for Tamil and Latin scripts. The font family wasnâ€™t<br>
            developed by one person but is a project led by NDISCOVER which<br> is a design
            foundry founded in Portugal.</p>
            <br>
        <p>The font family has been tested on low resolution phones and refined<br>
            to work well as a web font in the mobile era.</p>
