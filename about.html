              Portuguese type designer Joana Correia initially studied architecture in
              Porto where she graduated in 2003. In 2008 she decided to go back to studying
              and enrolled at the Graphic Design department of ESAD in Matosinhos, where she
              graduated in 2010. Since having completed an MA in Typeface Design at the University
              of Reading (UK) in 2011 Joana has been working as an independent type designer.
              She develops typefaces for various entities such as Google Fonts, FontYou and
              also develops her own designs. Her interest in the world’s linguistic systems 
              lead her to design typefaces for the Devanagari writing system. Joana teaches
              type design at ESAD where she shares her love for letters with the students.</p>
